## Rhino webradio CMS Project
### A new hope for radio resistance

Rhino CMS aims to allow an emancipation from centralized streaming platforms to radio collectives, channels and networks.

It is a free software project, to which you're invited to give us your feedback, your technical help, etc.

For now, it is only at a very primary state and is still missing some basic functionnality. We hope to release a first public version in late 2018.

### The webradio CMS we've all been waiting

If you've looked for a simple, functional, designed for radio CMS, it's highly probable you've never found it.
Rhino CMS embeds a homemade player with the ability to generate conditional playlists, to switch between podcasts and live shows, and many other features.

### A federated platform for federated broadcasts

OK, we love federated platforms like Mastodon, Peertube, and so on. We believe in the struggle to re-decentralize the internet, and [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) is exactly the tool we were missing to help building networks of independent medias. 

For the moment, ActivityPub is not yet implemented in Rhino CMS but it's one of the main key features we'd love to offer in the next major updates.

### Social interactions

For the moment, social interactions are inexistent. We're interested in Matrix for chatrooms, 

### Yunohost integration

Rhino CMS is already compatible with Yunohost !
